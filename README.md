# CSC-495-Final-Project
Group repository for our final project in 495

Object tracking system\
Posture Detection:
- Machine learning model to detect joint positions
- Servo motors to control small model that replicates movement seen from vision (Motor driver board)
- Model will just detect and replicate posture/movement
- Model that replicates movement is miniature
- Miniature model can be made from foam board and hot glued together
- Use multiple portentas to generalize movement from different vision angles
- “Stick figure” model to represent joints + movement in simple fashion

Think a little bit smaller in the beginning to make sure that you have a concept that works for the micro controller and the machine learning model. Condense down to smallest unit before starting.
